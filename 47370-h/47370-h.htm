<h2>A GRAND OLD GARDENER.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>["Through the death of Mr. <span class="smcap">Peter Grieve</span> we
have lost one of our best-known landscape gardeners,
also a distinguished hybridest and cross-breeder."&mdash;<i>Daily
Chronicle.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>
Good gardeners grieve for Mr. <span class="smcap">Peter Grieve</span>,<br />
Who landscape-gardening art has had to leave,<br />
To our regret. Hybridest and cross-breeder,<br />
He in the Garden-World was a great leader.<br />
"Suffolk Sir <span class="smcap">Joseph Paxton</span>" he was called.<br />
From many an English garden, snugly walled<br />
And florally embellished, plaints will come.<br />
He many a zonal pelargonium,<br />
Double petunia, and other blossom,<br />
Has left, of a new race, to deck earth's bosom.<br />
Better than selfish climb to place and power<br />
It is to bless our world with a new flower.<br />
Better than many Tsars, depend upon it,<br />
This Floral King deserves an ode or sonnet.<br />
<span class="smcap">Peter the Great</span> <i>was</i> great, but one lived later<br />
Whom sorrowing <i>Punch</i> dares dub "<span class="smcap">Peter the Greater</span>!"<br />

<p>"<span class="smcap">The Cultivation of Bees.</span>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I
see this subject taken up in the <i>Standard</i>,
but have not had time to peruse the correspondence.
I doubt whether bees can be
cultivated. I have seen a Learned Pig, Clever
Cats, Industrious Hoppers, all thoroughly
trained; but never have I come across a
Cultivated Bee. The bee is too busy as a
worker even to have the leisure which cultivation
requires. I have heard of a bee
getting so far in his education as to become
a "Spelling Bee." But even the "Spelling
Bees" seem to have had their day and died
out. Yours,</p>

<p class="right">

<h2>LETTERS TO A FIANCÉE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Gladys</span>,&mdash;I think your <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> the ideal person to be
engaged to. He's serious, you say&mdash;he dislikes flippancy&mdash;he's
inclined to be literal.</p>

<p>Well, surely that's better than being a clown, a buffoon, a mere
jester, a Court Fool! How tired you'd get of the cap and bells! of
having to laugh, all through life, at your husband's jokes! <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>
is sensible; calm in his affection. Is that a reproach? Should you
like a "Once-on-board-the-lugger-and-the-girl-is-mine" sort of
villain as a lover? Or a "ladies' man"&mdash;a warbler of love-songs&mdash;a
universal provider of compliments, flowers, pretty speeches,&mdash;a very
<span class="smcap">Whitely</span> of gallantry? You'd be bored to death: and dreadfully
jealous as well.</p>

<p>As to your tastes not being identical, that doesn't really matter.
Make a few sacrifices of those things you don't care about; bicycling,
for instance, and skirt-dancing, and then, in return for such self-denial,
he'll probably waive his objections to afternoons, private
views, or even&mdash;in moderation&mdash;clever young men.</p>

<p>On some subjects, I know, sympathy seems impossible; for
instance, <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> likes music, but detests concerts: while you, on
the other hand, while not caring for music are particularly fond of
concerts. A little mutual indulgence on both sides will soon put
matters straight.</p>

<p>After a slight dispute never hold out an <i>instant</i> after he shows
repentance. Also, <i>never avoid showing jealousy when you see he
expects it</i>. This is a valuable "tip." False pride on this subject is
a fruitful source of discord.</p>

<p>Do not disagree with his general principles. On the contrary,
second them; and give him convincing reasons for his own opinions.
When it comes to a particular application of them, that you really
object to you are sure to know how to act. Believe everything he
says, and never correct him about details, especially not if you know
you are right. I don't think I need advise you not to bring out
authorities to show he is wrong in the etymology of a word or any
other subject of discussion, for <i>that</i> is absolutely suicidal, and you
would be beyond the pale of reason if you dreamt of such a thing.</p>

<p>Since your cousin <span class="smcap">Freddy</span> has been staying with you, I can
understand you find it rather awkward. I know <span class="smcap">Freddy</span>; with his
love of practical jokes (for which you, too, I am certain, have a
secret <i>penchant</i>), and his determined chatter about his rowing, his
riding, and why he didn't back the winner, and how it is he missed
the Diamond Sculls, and so on, <i>ad lib.</i> I can quite fancy he doesn't
get on with <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>, whom he must despise for not having put a
hair-brush in his bed the very first evening.</p>

<p>You must have had a difficult day that Sunday that young <span class="smcap">De
Verney</span> and his sister came down. <span class="smcap">De Verney</span>, rosy-cheeked and
babyish-looking, but about whom a morbid interest centres, because
he collects jewels, and was said at one time to take morphia; and Miss
<span class="smcap">de Verney</span>, who "writes," and is utterly amazed and contemptuous
when she finds someone who has never heard of her. If it were not
for your mother, who forgets people's characteristics, and explains
them to each other a little wrong&mdash;which often saves the situation&mdash;the
day would have ended in utter want of harmony. <span class="smcap">De Verney</span>
left, pitying you, and his sister feeling sorry for <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>. I am
glad you removed&mdash;though only just in time&mdash;an absurd booby-trap
<span class="smcap">Freddy</span> had placed in <span class="smcap">Arthur's</span> room, because <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> had said he
"romped"; and when you and your future husband were alone, he
said he hoped your companions in the future would be of a very
different calibre to your present friends.</p>

<p>The depressing word "calibre," while cheering <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> left you in
lowest spirits, but of course you agreed, and then had a toboganning
match with <span class="smcap">Freddy</span> the next morning before breakfast, and before
<span class="smcap">Arthur</span> had left his room. Write and tell me how you are going on.
Is any time fixed for the termination of the engagement? I mean,
of course, by marriage.</p>

<p class="right">
Your affectionate friend,       <span class="smcap">Marjorie</span>.<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Maximus Orellius.</span>&mdash;The author of <i>John Bull and His Island</i> has
honoured a <i>South Wales Daily News</i> interviewer with many interesting
personal details. Mons. <span class="smcap">Blouët</span> has a rooted aversion to chairmen,
because "they give a sort of formal tone to proceedings which I
don't care for." Poor chairmen! After all, this is only what they
are intended for. Perhaps another <span class="smcap">Max</span>&mdash;yclept <span class="smcap">Nordan</span>&mdash;can give
some explanation for this distinctly morbid dislike. One unlucky
chairman is overwhelmed with ridicule because, in an introductory
speech, <i>he actually forgot the French humorist's name</i>.
"<span class="smcap">Max O'Rell</span>" contemplates changing his profession to that of
playwright, and has already written a play which he airily describes
as "a high-class comedy, dealing with the British aristocracy."
However, this is not his first dramatic venture, for, says he, "in 1870
I had a comedy produced in Paris, but the war breaking out my play
came to what I think was an untimely end. I have been repeatedly
urged to write for the stage, but have hitherto been content with the
success I have attained in other directions." <i>Vivat modestia!</i></p>

<h2>ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</h2>

<p>In a recent number of <i>The Saturday Review</i> I read a review of a
book of verse, which I need not particularise further, as I am not
concerned to affirm or to dispute the justice of the critic's estimate of
it. I only refer to it incidentally. The author, according to this
reviewer, possessed only the most elementary and commonplace
notion with regard to aptness of epithets or allusions. Instances
were cited, and we were further asked to believe that with this poet
(I quote from the <i>Saturday</i>) "the voluble thrush is a family man,
and the bibulous bee is a rover."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>That sentence absolutely fascinated me. It continued to ring and
ring in my brain for hours afterwards. It became the refrain to
everything I read and everything I thought of. There was only one
remedy. I promptly applied it, made a copy of verses to suit the
pursuing sentence, and was cured of my ailment.</p>

<hr />

<h2>A FAMILY MAN AND A ROVER.</h2>

<p>
A rook and an oyster agreed to dispute<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As to which held the record for darting:</span><br />
The rook said "I'm off like a punt on a chute,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said the oyster "I don't think I'm starting:</span><br />
That is, since I know I'm confoundedly slow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If the rook on the mark remains steady,</span><br />
I doubt if I'll wait till the starter says 'go,'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll be off when he says 'Are you ready?'"</span><br />
Then the languishing leopard cried "Run while you can,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the cricket remarked "Is it over?"</span><br />
But the voluble thrush was a family man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the bibulous bee was a rover.</span><br />
<br />
A celibate snipe thought they'd better look sharp,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the oyster said "Who's for the grotto?"</span><br />
Thus evoking a smile from a casual carp,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who had "<i>carpe diem</i>" for his motto.</span><br />
And a hairy old, hoary old ourang-outang<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grunted "Harmony, gents, or you'll bore us";</span><br />
And a bandy-legged beetle, when asked if he sang,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said he only obliged in a chorus.</span><br />
Then, to make matters smooth till the racing began,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dove, who had landed at Dover,</span><br />
Cooed "Voluble thrush, you're a family man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, oh bibulous bee, you're a rover."</span><br />
<br />
The runners themselves were contending for fun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a track which was wooded with parquet:</span><br />
The odds at the start were a million to one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which I quote as the state of the market.</span><br />
"Do you think they will win?" said a truculent shark;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the whale said, "I never think nuffing."</span><br />
"What a desperate race!" was the puffin's remark&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He was palpably pained by their puffing;</span><br />
Yet it cheered the whole clan, while their races they ran,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To know someone lived calmly in clover;</span><br />
For the voluble thrush was a family man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though the bibulous bee was a rover.</span><br />
<br />
Round, round came the rook, who was heartily clapped<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He was winning, wings down, in a canter;</span><br />
The succulent bivalve was collared and lapped,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In spite of his beard and his banter.</span><br />
But a rifle went off, and a dredger drew nigh;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We shall never know which was the winner,</span><br />
For the rook's next appearance was made in a pie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they served up the oyster at dinner.</span><br />
Which proves very plainly that life is a span;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We are cattle, and Death is our drover.</span><br />
Fate waits for the thrush, who's a family man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the bibulous bee, who's a rover.</span><br />
</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>No more this week. I am flying from a country where September
fails to provide anything but sunshine. Perhaps in Switzerland
there may be snow and a sweet foretaste of winter. At any rate, I
am off to find out for myself. My next "Roundabout Reading"
will be done in the country of Cantons. I shall study the <i>Referendum</i>
face to face!</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">In re Diggle <i>v.</i> the Progressives.</span>"&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Diggle</span> says, as long

to support the Progressives, and pay for it, is Re-diggle-ous! Quite so.</p>

<h2>SKETCHES FROM SCOTLAND.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">On a Callander Char-à-bancs.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>In front of the Trossachs Hotel. The few passengers bound
for Callander have been sitting for several minutes on the coach
"Fitz-James" in pelting rain, resignedly wondering when the
driver will consider them sufficiently wet to start.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Head Boots</i> (<i>to the driver</i>). There's another to come yet;
he'll no be lang now. (<i>The cause of the delay comes down the hotel
steps, and surveys the vehicle and its occupants with a surly scowl.</i>)
Up with ye, Sir, plenty of room on the second seats.</p>

<p><i>The Surly Passenger.</i> And have all the umbrellas behind dripping
on my hat! No, thank you, I'm going in front. (<i>He mounts, and
takes up the apron.</i>) Here, driver, just look at this apron&mdash;it's
sopping wet!</p>

<p><i>The Driver</i> (<i>tranquilly</i>). Aye, I'm thinking it wull ha' got a bet
domp.</p>

<p><i>The Surly P.</i> Well, I'm not going to have this over <i>me</i>. Haven't
you got a <i>dry</i> one somewhere?</p>

<p><i>The Driver.</i> There'll be
dry ones at Collander.</p>

<p><i>The Surly P.</i> (<i>with a
snort</i>). At Callander! Much
good that is! (<i>With crushing
sarcasm.</i>) If I'm to
keep dry on this concern, it
strikes me I'd better get
inside the boot at once!</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
    <a href="images/172.png"><img width="100%" src="images/172.png" alt="" /></a>

<p>"Ou aye, ye can get inside the boot if ye've a mind to it."</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Driver</i> (<i>with the air
of a man who is making a
concession</i>). Ou aye, ye can
get inside the boot if ye've
a mind to it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The coach starts, and is
presently stopped at a
corner to take up a male
and female passenger,
who occupy the seats
immediately behind the</i>
Surly Passenger.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Female P.</i> (<i>enthusiastically,
to her companion</i>).
There's dear old
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Macfarlane</span>, come out
to see the last of us! Look
at her standing out there in
the garden, all in the rain.
That's what I always <i>say</i>
about the Scotch&mdash;they <i>are</i>
warm-hearted!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She waves her hand in
farewell to some distant
object.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Her Companion.</i> <i>That</i>
ain't her; that's an old
apple-tree in the garden
<i>you</i>'re waving to. <i>She</i>'s
keeping in-doors&mdash;and shows
her sense too.</p>

<p><i>The Female P.</i> (<i>disgusted</i>).
Well, I <i>do</i> think after our being at the farm a fortnight and all, she
<i>might</i>&mdash;&mdash;But that's Scotch all <i>over</i>, that is; get all they <i>can</i>
out of you, and then, for anything <i>they</i> care&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>The Surly P.</i> I don't know whether you are aware of it, Ma'am,
but that umbrella of yours is sending a constant trickle down the
back of my neck, which is <i>most</i> unpleasant!</p>

<p><i>The Female P.</i> I'm sorry to hear it, Sir, but it's no worse for you
than it is for me. I've got somebody else's umbrella dripping down
<i>my</i> back, and <i>I</i> don't complain.</p>

<p><i>The Surly P.</i> I <i>do</i>, Ma'am, for, being in front, I haven't even the
poor consolation of feeling that my umbrella is a nuisance to
anybody.</p>

<p><i>A Sardonic P.</i> (<i>in the rear, politely</i>). On the contrary, Sir, I find
it a most pleasing object to contemplate. Far more picturesque, I
don't doubt, than any scenery it may happen to conceal.</p>

<p><i>A Chatty P.</i> (<i>to the driver; not because he cares, but simply for
the sake of conversation</i>). What fish do you catch in that river
there?</p>

<p><i>The Driver</i> (<i>with an effort</i>). There'll be troots, an, maybe, a
pairrch or two.</p>

<p><i>The Chatty P.</i> Perch? Ah, that's rather like a goldfish in
shape, eh?</p>

<p><i>Driver</i> (<i>cautiously</i>). Aye, it would be that.</p>

<p><i>Chatty P.</i> Only considerably bigger, of course.</p>

<p><i>Driver</i> (<i>evasively</i>). Pairrch is no a verra beg fesh.</p>

<p><i>Chatty P.</i> But bigger than goldfish.</p>

<p><i>Driver</i> (<i>more confidently</i>). Ou aye, they'll be begger than goldfesh.</p>

<p><i>Chatty P.</i> (<i>persistently</i>). You've seen goldfish&mdash;know what
they're <i>like</i>, eh?</p>

<p><i>Driver</i> (<i>placidly</i>). I canna say I do.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>They pass a shooting party with beaters.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Chatty P.</i> (<i>as before</i>). What are they going to shoot?</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> They'll jist be going up to the hells for a bet grouse
drivin'.</p>

<p><i>A Lady P.</i> I wonder why they carry those poles with the red
and yellow flags. I suppose they're to warn tourists to keep out of
range when they begin firing at the butts. I know they <i>have</i> butts
up on the moor, because I've seen them. Just look at those birds
running after that man throwing grain for them. Would those be
<i>grouse?</i></p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> Ye'll no find grouse so tame as that, Mem; they'll jist
be phaysants.</p>

<p><i>The Lady P.</i> Poor dear things! why, they're as tame as chickens.
It <i>does</i> seem so cruel to kill
them!</p>

<p><i>Her Comp.</i> Well, but
they kill chickens, occasionally.</p>

<p><i>The Lady P.</i> Not with a
horrid gun; and, besides,
that's such a totally different
thing.</p>

<p><i>The Chatty P.</i> What do
you call that mountain,
driver, eh?</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> Yon hell? I'm
no minding its name.</p>

<p><i>The Surly P.</i> You don't
seem very ready in pointing
out the objects of interests
on the route, I must say.</p>

<p><i>Driver</i> (<i>modestly</i>). There'll
be them on the corch that
know as much aboot it as
myself. (<i>After a pause&mdash;to
vindicate his character as a
cicerone.</i>) Did ye nottice a
bit building at the end of the
loch over yonder?</p>

<p><i>The Surly P.</i> No, I didn't.</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> Ye might ha' seen
it had ye looked.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He relapses into a contented
silence.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Chatty P.</i> Anything remarkable
about the building?</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> It was no the
building that's remairkable.
(<i>After a severe struggle with
his own reticence.</i>) It was
jist the spoat. 'Twas there
<i>Roderick Dhu</i> fought <i>Fitz-James</i>
after convoying him
that far on his way.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The</i> Surly Passenger
<i>snorts as though he didn't consider this information</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Lady P.</i> (<i>who doesn't seem to be up in her "Lady of the
Lake"</i>). <i>Fitz-James who?</i></p>

<p><i>Her Comp.</i> I fancy he's the man who owns this line of coaches.
There's his name on the side of this one.</p>

<p><i>The Lady P.</i> And I saw <i>Roderick Dhu's</i> on another coach. I
<i>thought</i> it sounded familiar, somehow. He must be the <i>rival</i> proprietor,
I suppose. I wonder if they've made it up yet.</p>

<p><i>The Driver</i> (<i>to the</i> Surly Passenger, <i>with another outburst of communicativeness</i>).
Yon stoan is called "<span class="smcap">Sawmson's</span> Putting Stoan."
He hurried it up to the tope of the hell, whaur it's bided ever sence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The</i> Surly Passenger <i>receives this information with an incredulous
grunt</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Lady P.</i> What a magnificent old ruin that is across the
valley, some ancient castle, evidently; they can't build like that
nowadays!</p>

<p><i>The Driver.</i> That's the Collander Hydropawthec, Mem; burrnt
doon two or three years back.</p>

<p><i>The Lady P.</i> (<i>with a sense of the irony of events</i>). <i>Burnt</i> down!
A Hydropathic! Fancy!</p>

<p><i>Male P.</i> (<i>as they enter Callander and pass a trim villa</i>). There,
<i>that's</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Figgis's</span> place.</p>

<p><i>His Comp.</i> What&mdash;<i>that?</i> Why, it's quite a <i>bee-yutiful</i> place,

<h2>THE WHEEL OF FATE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Fragment of an Old Romance, slightly Modernised.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXI.</span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Grammercy!</span>" quoth the Baron <span class="smcap">d'Agincourt</span>, as he rolled off
his bicycle into a potato-bed; "'tis a full-mettled steed! Methinks
those varlets have fed him with overmuch oil of late, so restive is he
become. And, lack-a-day! My doublet is besmirched with mire!
Thou smilest, I see, <span class="smcap">Agatha</span>. There is but scant reason for merriment,
shameless girl!"</p>

<p>"Nay," replied the beauteous
Lady <span class="smcap">Agatha</span>, as
with exquisite skill she
rode her dainty steed (a
thorough-bred Coventry)
up and down the terrace,
"'twas not at thy mishap,
dear father! Of a truth
thou must be sorely bruised.
Was not that thy seventh
fall this afternoon? If I
smile, 'tis but that I am
happy."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the
Baron, as he hopped painfully
behind his machine,
vainly endeavouring to
mount anew. "Happy, eh?
And wherefore? Whom
hast thou seen to change
thy mood so greatly since
this morning? 'Twas but
a few hours ago that thou
wast weeping over some
trifle of a spilt oil-can.
Ah, I am up at last!"</p>

<p>"I have seen none," said
the lovely maiden, with blushing cheeks; "at least, save only&mdash;&mdash;"
She hesitated, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Whom, girl?" insisted her father.</p>

<p>"Sir <span class="smcap">Algernon Fitzclarence</span>."</p>

<p>With a desperate swerve, the Baron rode towards her, his face
purple with passion.</p>

<p>"What, thou hast chosen to disobey me again? Talking with
him whom I had forbidden to come within twenty leagues of my
castle! Now, by St. Humber, both thou and he shall rue this day!
I say that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Baron's skill failed him once more, and he was shot off into the
gooseberry-bushes.</p>

<p>"Nay, hear me, dear father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cease!" roared the angry Baron. "What ho, there! Lead the
Lady <span class="smcap">Agatha</span>," he commanded, as twenty men rushed forwards in
answer to his summons, "into the upper dungeon. And, varlets,
bring me the sticking-plaster."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXII.</span></p>

<p>'Twas midnight. Alone in the dismal cell to which her father's
cruelty had consigned her, the Lady <span class="smcap">Agatha</span> wept unceasingly.
Sleep came not to her weary eyes, she paced restlessly up and down,
or gazed through the narrow bars of the window over the moonlit
landscape.</p>

<p>Suddenly she started! Was it fancy? Nay, 'twas a human
voice, manly, resonant, and strong, that sang beneath her window.
She could catch some of the words:</p>

<p>
"O sweetest blossom of the lea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O daintiest flower of the field!</span><br />
For love, for hopeless love of thee<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My reason must her kingdom yield" ...</span><br />
</p>

<p>Good heavens! It was <span class="smcap">Algernon Fitzclarence</span>!</p>

<p>
"Across the land, across the main,<br />
A single steed shall bear us twain."<br />
</p>

<p>He was ascending by a ladder! His face appeared at the window!</p>

<p>"Ah, darling <span class="smcap">Agatha</span>," he said, "news was brought me of thy
parlous state! But dry thy tears, my sweet! See"&mdash;he snapped
the massive bars with the little finger of his left hand&mdash;"the cage
is broken. Two of the swiftest Singers are saddled for us at the
castle gate. Let us fly together!"</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Noiselessly the gallant steeds flitted along the road.</p>

<p>"Were't not best to light our lamps?" whispered <span class="smcap">Agatha</span>.
"Methinks that the sage councillors of the parish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, I fear them not," said the intrepid <span class="smcap">Fitzclarence</span>. "Enough
for me is the light of thine eyes."</p>

<p>Suddenly their steeds slackened pace simultaneously, and a faint
hissing sound was heard. They looked at one another, and groaned.</p>

<p>"We are punctured!" cried Agatha. It was too true. At the
foot of a steep hill they dismounted, their tyres flabby, shapeless,
useless. <span class="smcap">Fitsclarence</span> passed his hand over the ground.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
    <a href="images/173.png"><img width="100%" src="images/173.png" alt="" /></a>

<p>"He vanished over the cliff."</p>
</div>

<p>"As I thought!" he said bitterly, "'tis thy father that hath
contrived this! He hath scattered tin-tacks broadcast over the road
to foil our attempt to escape! But we will baffle him yet."</p>

<p>For some minutes he worked his air-pump in silence. Suddenly
a sound was heard at which <span class="smcap">Agatha</span> grew deathly pale. It was the
clear resonant note of a bicycle bell!</p>

<p>"We are pursued!" she cried. "Let us fly, <span class="smcap">Algernon</span>."</p>



<p>"We cannot," said her practical lover; "the tyres are almost
empty. We can but meet our doom bravely!"</p>

<p>Louder and louder came the noise of whirring wheels. Then&mdash;a
whirr, and the Baron, breathless, pale with terror, went by them like
a flash of lightning! <span class="smcap">Fitzclarence</span> understood in a moment what
had happened. The Baron was but an unskilful rider, and had
allowed his machine to run away with him down the hill!</p>


<p>To stop him was impossible. He went along the highway for
thirty-two and a half miles, and then, with a last despairing yell,
he vanished over the cliff, still seated on his steed, and was buried
beneath the waves of the English Channel. So <span class="smcap">Fitzclarence</span> and
<span class="smcap">Agatha</span> returned to the castle, and lived happily ever after.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>In the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> the Baron skimmed an article on "The
Gold-mining Madness in the City," by <span class="smcap">S. F. Van Oss</span>. There's a
deal of method in this madness. Isn't it rather presumptuous in a
"Van Oss" to advise Bulls and Bears not to make asses of themselves?</p>

<p>Amusing article in <i>Macmillan</i> for this month on "Moll Cutpurse."
Even <span class="smcap">Oliver</span>, the Protector, couldn't protect himself from
this nimble-handed, light-fingered lady, who entertained very practical
notions on the Common-wealth.</p>

<p>Capital chatty book, published by <span class="smcap">Arrowsmith</span> (but evidently
ought to have been published by "<span class="smcap">Chatty and Windus</span>"), is

<p>According to orders issued September 29, Feast of St. Goose, the
Vice-Chancellor has given notice that during Michaelmas Term there
will be Congregations, when will be performed by the A. C. C. C.
(Amateur Cambridge Concert Club) the well-known Choral, "<i>Goosey
Goosey Gander</i>." (Music by <span class="smcap">Goosens</span>.) The Volunteers will practice
the Goose Step from two to four every afternoon till further orders.</p>

<p>After exams, the ceremony of "Plucking" will take place in public.</p>

<p>Lectures on "<i>How to get your Goose Cooked</i>," with receipts for
<i>Making the sauce for the gander</i>, by M. C. A. (Master of Culinary Art).</p>

<p>Lecture on the right explanation of the treatise "<i>De Goose-tibus</i>."
[N.B.&mdash;<i>The undergraduate who comes out first in examination
on this subject will be entitled to wear a feather in his cap.</i>]</p>

<p>Special Greek Kalendary Lecture on the history of "<i>Xerxes and

<p>The subject of the Lecture on Horticulture will be "<i>The Growth
of the Great Gooseberry, and its Gradual Extinction</i>."</p>

<p><i>Commercial History.</i> Subject: "<i>On Banking, and the Rise of

<h2>TO A FRIEND OF MINE.</h2>

<p>
Ah, cherubic little curate, in your surplice spick and span,<br />
Who has struck that happy medium 'twixt an angel and a man,<br />
Would it bore you much to tell me how you managed to attain<br />
To that turret of perfection which in time I hope to gain?<br />
<br />
For I see you in the pulpit, and I dote upon your word,<br />
And I listen to such eloquence as rarely I have heard;<br />
But at times there comes a whisper, like the flutter on the wind,<br />
Were you always, little curate, such a pattern of your kind?<br />
<br />
When a schoolboy, young and noisy, did you never tell a fib,<br />
Or use a <span class="smcap">Kelly's</span> literal "key" (ah, call it not a crib!)?<br />
Did you never, at a season when your age was hardly ripe,<br />
Encircle with your rosy lips a surreptitious pipe?<br />
<br />
And when you went to Cambridge was your 'Varsity career<br />
As spotless as your surplice, and as uniformly clear<br />
From a vestige of a blemish? Oh, you <i>properest</i> of men,<br />
Were you never, never proctored&mdash;were you <i>always</i> in at ten?<br />

<h2>SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Happy Lots for Happy Scots.</span>&mdash;The
<i>Glasgow Herald</i> has been making fun of
the Scotch&mdash;no, we mean the Scottish&mdash;no,
we don't, we mean the Scots&mdash;Professor.
Here is its description of him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He, and he alone, can lead a perfectly groomed
life. He has an income of between £600 and
£2,000 a year. At the outside his work, after he
has fairly got settled down to it, means four hours
a day for five days a week during six months of the
year.... The modern Scotch professor in fact is,
or ought to be, that "model man of the world," of
whom all of us poor slaves of business and convention
stand secretly in awe.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the St. Andrews golf links he is to be
seen on great occasions "living up to his
moustaches and knickerbockers." He has his
London club, mingles in the highest literary
coteries, and is always talking about "charming
girls." Evidently the professorial chair
in a Norbritish University is a very comfortable
kind of arm-chair, and our "Arts Professor"
a professor&mdash;and practiser, too&mdash;of
various useful arts.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Wail from the West.</span>&mdash;They are trying
at Bristol to move the G. W. R. to give
better train facilities between Bristol, Salisbury,
Southampton, and Portsmouth; and
the Chamber of Commerce has sent in a
memorial asking for a "complete remodelling
of the service between such important centres
of commercial activity," and complaining of
the "unsatisfactory service of trains on other
parts of your system," particularly on the
Devizes, Marlborough, and Reading branch.
Why, suggests the Chamber, not run three
fast trains a day up and down <i>viâ</i> the new
Holt Junction, "instead of all trains going
into Trowbridge, and waiting nearly an
hour." Why, indeed? West-of-Englanders
seem to think that "your system" needs
strengthening, and so they are supplying a
little bark as a tonic, for "local application"
only.</p>

<p>
To this Chamber of Commerce the fault of the Co.<br />
Is running too seldom, and moving too slow.<br />

<h2>THE LAST TURNPIKE.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>["The last of the old turnpike trusts is to terminate
on the 1st of November."&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>
Remember, remember the first of November!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The old turnpike system grew old, ripe, and rotten;</span><br />
But man loves to dream by the Past's waning ember,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And turnpikes, though troublesome, won't be forgotten.</span><br />
Like old inns and highwaymen, stocks and stage-coaches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The white turnpike bars have their memories fragrant;</span><br />
But on quaint antiquities Progress encroaches.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The knight of the road, and the picturesque vagrant,</span><br />
The "Highflyer" coach and the postchaise have vanished;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now the old turnpike is destined to follow.</span><br />
When from his snug box the last toll-taker's banished,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One feels the Romance of the Road will sound hollow.</span><br />
The toll was a nuisance, the toll-keeper grumpy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He turned out to pocket his coppers and tanners</span><br />
With curt elocution which made one feel jumpy;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There wasn't much charm in his dress or his manners.</span><br />
His "stand and deliver" made timid folk quiver,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when not despotic he mostly looked drowsy;</span><br />
He'd keep you a-waiting till all of a shiver,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then yawn on you, looking forbidding and frowsy.</span><br />
And yet his snug box and white bars had attractions.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gleam from his fire, the red rose o'er his portal,</span><br />
Would make you forgive his rough ways and exactions,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And <span class="smcap">Turpin</span> and <i>Weller</i> have made him immortal.</span><br />
His locks, bolts, and bars were extremely obstructive,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But then his white apron and mannerless greeting&mdash;</span><br />
In retrospect&mdash;take on a something seductive.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sure oft on our highways his spook, slowly fleeting,</span><br />
With glimmering shirt-sleeves and coin-chinking pocket,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will haunt the lone traveller; make him remember</span><br />
The jolly old days of the fast-rattling "Rocket,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And heave one sad sigh for this fatal November.</span><br />
</p>

<hr />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Approbation from Sir Hubert Stanley
is praise indeed!</span>"&mdash;Sir <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> was highly
pleased with the Leeds Festival chorus-folk.
"I praise you," he said to them, "from the
bottom of my heart." Praise from "the top
of a heart" would be nothing, but to pump it
up, from the depths, expresses the profundity
of admiration. Then added Sir Arthur,
"The greatest privilege of my life is"&mdash;now
just pause; think what could possibly be "the
greatest privilege" of Sir <span class="smcap">Arthur Sullivan's</span>
life? The privilege of musical genius? No.
Give it up? Yes. Then read on. "The
greatest privilege of my life is that His Royal
Highness will, at my request, tell you
what he thinks of the chorus." O immortal
<i>Jabberwock!</i></p>

<p class="center">
"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He chortled in his joy."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Whereupon H. R. H. observed, most discreetly,
"It is not for me to make criticisms;
that I leave to your amiable conductor."
Bee-ew-tiful!! This chorus will "get a
bit above itself." Dangerous precedent, O
amiable conductor!</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He scans in a "split second,"</span><br />
And in "two jiffs" of scampering quest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Stars and Stripes are "reckoned."</span><br />
They're "gathered" in his shallow brain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like pea-nuts in a pannikin.</span><br />
Bah! <span class="smcap">Smorltork</span> is a vapid, vain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vituperative mannikin.</span><br />
"Potry, poltic, science, art,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>All</i> tings"&mdash;from pigs to pictures&mdash;</span><br />
He bans in criticisms "smart,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sciolistic strictures.</span><br />
Of courtesy the open shame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of feelings coarse affronter.</span><br />
He's only fit to play the game<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leo Hunter</span>.</span><br />
For when to other lands he strays,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fool insults their banners,</span><br />
Because <i>he</i> doesn't like their ways,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor understand their manners.</span><br />
Peripatetic <i>Podsnap</i>, he<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Makes <i>Punch's</i> nerves feel tinglish,</span><br />
Who naught of good abroad can see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because it is not "English."</span><br />
Ah, Brother <span class="smcap">Jonathan</span>, old friend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Smorltork chitter-chatter</span><br />
Some day, like Tammany, will end,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Meanwhile it doesn't matter.</span><br />
The <span class="smcap">Smorltorks</span> are a shallow set,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cantankerous and cranky;</span><br />
But <i>Punch</i> takes not from them, "you bet,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His notions of things Yankee!</span><br />

<p><span class="smcap">Net Profits.</span>&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Cumming Macdona</span>,
M. P.'s recent letter to the <i>Times</i> about the
hundred French boats that he saw starting
from Dieppe for a three months' fishing cruise
off the west coast of Ireland, has led to a
demand by Irish papers for Government help
to Irish fisheries. Why, they ask, should
money be given to farmers and not to fishers?
The <i>Cork Constitution</i>, however, goes to the
root of things by saying that "want of enterprise
and thrift," not want of pence, leads to
Irish fish being caught by the anglers of
Dieppe. The State has already constructed
improved harbours and light railways. It is
for the fisher-folk to respond by getting boats
and nets, and using them; until which time
the early Gaul will get the best haul.</p>

<h2>CABBY; OR, REMINISCENCES OF THE RANK AND THE ROAD.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By "Hansom Jack."</i>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>["Gentlemen, the way to see London is from the top of a 'bus&mdash;from the
top of a 'bus, gentlemen!"&mdash;<i>Mr. Gladstone to American Visitors.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">No. VII.&mdash;'BUSSES, BILKS, AND BOOSYS.</p>

<p>
Top of a 'bus! Well, I've nothing to say against knifeboards or garden-seats, quite the contrairy.<br />
Looked at as look-outs on London itself, <i>as</i> a city, they're easy, commanding, and airy.<br />
G. O. M. hit it in once to those Yankees. But still, if you'd view London <i>life</i>, as a wholer,<br />
Not mere bricks and mortar and lamp-posts, I'll back what cute <span class="smcap">Benjamin D.</span> called the London Gond&#333;ler.<br />
<br />
<i>I</i>'ve drove the Grand Old One, though 'e's such a walker 'e don't give the wheels so much work as did <span class="smcap">Dizzy</span>.<br />
But I'd like to stick 'im some hours on <i>my</i> perch with my 'ed at 'is elber. Ah, <i>then</i> we'd be busy.<br />
The 'bus 'as the pull of us one way, you see; <i>our</i> fares can't git mounting the roof; they're insiders!<br />
But Cabby looks inside <i>and</i> out, and that way gits the bulge on the rest of the drivers and riders.<br />
<br />
Moresomeover the 'busses and trams keep the main, whilst we 'Ansoms can take all the short-cuts and bye-ways;<br />
And when you know sububs and slums, you're aware London life don't all run in the big stream of 'ighways.<br />
Its creeks and its backwaters, ditches and dykes, they teem, fairly teem, though their dwellers&mdash;poor cusses!&mdash;<br />
Can only just ketch the tram-bells in the distance, and ain't never bossed from the knifeboards of 'busses.<br />
<br />
That's just where swell ink-slingers miss the true London. That wasn't the way though with good <span class="smcap">Charley Dickens</span>.<br />
<i>Pickwick</i> is one of the books in our Shelter, and <i>Pickwick</i>, I 'old, gives the reader rare pickins.<br />
When drying my legs over corfee and heggs I git a larf out o' that patter o' <i>Sammy</i>.<br />
It ain't quite <i>our</i> up-to-date kibosh, o' course, but the way as that <i>Sam</i> chewed the rag was just jammy.<br />
<br />
Knowed some queer things about London, <i>'e</i> did, <i>'is</i> London, of course, cabrioleys and such-like.<br />
<i>My</i> survey's "extensive," and likeways "pecooliar," in that me and <i>Sammy</i> seem much of a much like.<br />
A whip, like old <i>Weller</i>, I do not, like 'im, do the same bit o' road, come-day-go-day together.<br />
I know, in my line, every inch of the town, at all times o' day, and in all sorts o' weather.<br />
<br />
I'd just like a turn "Round the Town" with young <i>Sam</i>, or a talk over sossige and mashed in our Shelter;<br />
Comparing of notes, with the Growler for chorus, I 'aven't no doubt we should come out a pelter.<br />
"Cabby," they sing, "knows 'is fare." I should think so, or else 'e must be a blind mug or a babby.<br />
And who, from a dook to a chorister minx, 'asn't, one time or other, <i>been</i> "fare" to a Cabby?<br />
<br />
I've driven the dook and the damsel together, as fur as that goes. And the dook was that squiffy<br />
'E wanted to go me "dooks up" for the fare. But that would 'ave brought down the slops in a jiffy.<br />
You mustn't 'ave <i>much</i> flesh and blood, as a Cabby, I tell you. At scrapping we're most of us 'andy;<br />
But knockin' out nobs, as a rule, doesn't pay, when said nobs 'ave been mixing champagne and neat brandy.<br />
<br />
The boosys and bilks try our tempers, I tell you. But tempers are luxuries, like sparrer grass is.<br />
If you've seen a helderly, hamorous gent, <i>on</i> the tiddley, you know what a worriting ass is.<br />
Argue for hours about sixpence, 'e will, then 'unt all 'is pockets, and find 'e aint got one.<br />
Collapse in a corner, and fall fast asleep, with a boiled baby smile on 'is chump. <i>'E</i>'s a 'ot one.<br />
<br />
Hit 'im? Oh no! 'E may waste you a hour, and then offer a drink, which 'e 'asn't the price of,<br />
And maunder and mumble till you are arf mad; but if an old stager you'll take the advice of,<br />
You <i>won't</i> knock 'is 'ead off! It's tempting, I know, and sometimes you would give twice the fare for the pleasure;<br />
But squiffy old gents are the magistrates' pets, they've got money&mdash;at 'ome&mdash;and, what's more, lots of leisure!<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">Treacle</span>" now, can't 'old 'is tongue with old Tiddleys. Poor "<span class="smcap">Treacle</span>" was once a smart gentleman farmer,<br />
And kep 'is own dog-cart. 'E's got one fair daughter, who, even in chocolate cotton's a charmer.<br />
Ah! sweet as fresh 'ay, in a manner o' speaking, is young <span class="smcap">Bessie Finch</span>, though she's but a machiner.<br />
Its curious 'ow sulky old "<span class="smcap">Treacle</span>" lights up when 'is gal <span class="smcap">Bessie</span> brings 'im 'is poor bit o' dinner.<br />
<br />
'E was just taking up an old Tiddley one time when Miss <span class="smcap">Bessie</span> turned up, and the bosky old geeser<br />
Made eyes at the maid, and said just arf a word, when poor <span class="smcap">Treacle's</span> fist caught 'im a slap on 'is sneezer<br />
As made 'im see stars. 'Twas a trifle too previous, p'r'aps, for a sulky old chip of a Cabby;<br />
A 'ero don't <i>look</i> like a 'ero somehow when 'is phiz is wind-blue and 'is billycock shabby.<br />
<br />
Old Tiddley was quite a respectable gent, a benevolent buffer, who lived out at Clapham;<br />
And when subub saints 'ave been dining a mossel, it won't do for grumpy old Growlers to slap 'em.<br />
So "<span class="smcap">Treacle</span>," as usual, got toko, you see, likeways missed a good fare, 'long o' bein' too 'asty;<br />
Which shows as a Cabby 'is temper must check, and in trifles must not be <i>too</i> ticklish or tasty.<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Something Attractive in a Name.</span>&mdash;Among the directors on

delightful name which we have not seen in real life since it first

surname is "<span class="smcap">Leite</span>," and he is "Director of the Miner's Dream
Gold Mines, Limited,"&mdash;why limit a "dream"? Is it not delightfully
attractive? We trust "<span class="smcap">Alf Pinto</span>" will find plenty of <i>Whole
Quartz O!</i> and that the success of the "M. T. G. M." may be the
exact opposite of its two first initials, <i>i.e.</i>, not "M. T." but quite
full, up to the brim.</p>

question of Canadian copyright has at length made some steps
towards a settlement." Mr. <span class="smcap">Caine</span>, who has sailed for Canada,
as one of the "settlers," is equal to "two single gentleman rolled
into one," being certainly <span class="smcap">Caine</span> and, most decidedly, Able.</p>
